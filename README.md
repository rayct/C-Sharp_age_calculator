## Here's an example program in C# that calculates a person's age and the number of days until their next birthday:

## This program will prompt the user for their date of birth, and then it will calculate current age, the day of the week you were born on, and the number of days until your next birthday.

## To use the program, simply run it in a IDE or code editor environment and follow the prompts.


# Version: 1.0.2
## An optimized version of the previous C# program:
## This optimized version of the program uses the DayOfYear property of DateTime objects to calculate the age and the days until the next birthday.
## The DayOfYear property returns the day of the year (1-365) for a given DateTime object, which simplifies the calculation.
## Additionally, the conditional operator (?:) is used to simplify the age calculation.


# Version: 1.0
## This C# version of the program uses DateTime objects to represent dates, which makes it simpler and more concise than the C++ version.
## It also uses string interpolation ($"{variable}") to format strings, which makes the output code easier to read.
## The Parse() method of the DateTime class is used to convert the user input string into a DateTime object,and the DayOfWeek property is used to determine the day of the week of the birthdate.
